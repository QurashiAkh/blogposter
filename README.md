It is a Small Web Application made to demonstrate how HTTP and Internet Protocols generally work.
Developed by [Husayn al-Qurashi](https://github.com/QurashiAkh).

I developed this Web App using the Python Programming Language, by the Help of the [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and the SQLAlchemy API. I set Templates using the Jinja Templating Library and routed each Webpage for its own Template, although some routes (e.g. `/posts` and `/posts/edit`) do support `POST` Methods too and not only `GET` Methods - in which a Jinja Template is served.  
  
Concerning the UI (i.e. User Interface), I've used [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), which is a light-weight CSS Library. Skeleton did help me improve the UI of the Web App via its simple class-based CSS styling.  
  
As of the Favicon, I've used [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/x) to design it.
